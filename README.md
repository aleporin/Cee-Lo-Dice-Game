### **_Description_**

####  I am building a dice game called “Cee-Lo” . It is computer vs user . There are 3 dice . You must roll 2 of the same and then the 3rd is your number. For example, if you roll 3-3-4 your number is 4. If you roll a 1,2,3 you lose . If you roll a 4,5,6 you automatically win. If you roll 3 of the same but the other person rolls a higher triple you lose. You roll until you roll one of these conditions.
