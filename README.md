### **_Description_**

####  Cee-Lo: Everyone's favorite three dice game! Cee-Lo is a game I grew up playing with family and continued playing with friends throughout college. Naturally, I thought this would be an awesome game to build after my first two weeks in General Assemblys Software Engineering Immersive course. One thing that was big for me when thinking about my project was creating a project that was meaningful to me. This was an awesome experience and great first project!

### **_Technologies Used_**

-HTML
-CSS
-Javescript

### **_Getting Started_**

#### I started off with a white board and a bunch of ideas. I had only played Cee-Lo with real dice and against friends. I began by building a base layer for my HTML with some CSS on it. I then went to hardcoding in a bunch of Javascript conditions that met the rules of the game.  

#### My project can be played [here](https://cee-lo-dice-game.surge.sh/pageTwo.html).
